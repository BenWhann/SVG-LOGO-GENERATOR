## Credits

My friend Kai who is a software engineer helped me out a bit with this one. We pair programmed for about an hour to solve an issue that I was stuck with. He didn't give me any answers, just guided me in the right direction, and that helped me gain a deeper understanding of what I was learning. I wish I knew his GitHub at the moment, but I don't.
